## From wireframe to simple HTML
We had as a school assignment in the course graphic tools for UI to make a wireframe, mockup and a simple HTML page of the result.
I was using grid by 12 in Photoshop for my layout. To be the first time to make a wireframe and mockup it went so so but fun. Hard to get all the spaces between the objects right.
And as a flex user I tryed to use grid for the most part of the layout. It wasnÂ´t the fastest way but quite educational to use the things you don't use to often.
